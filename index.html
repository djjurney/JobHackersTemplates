    Hi, I see you posted a web dev role. Initially, on paper, I may not jump off the page as an obvious candidate. I have a very strong value proposition to present as an Entry Level Front-End Developer. Would you allow me a moment to paint a picture of my value proposition to you?  With 20 years as a paramedic, I have applied split second problem-solving and decision-making abilities in high pressure, and high intensity environments, directly transferable to being a successful Full Stack Web Developer. My grit and determination to transition my career to Full Stack Developer enabled me to complete the necessary bootcamp and acquire the knowledge of an entry level Full Stack Developer. On your team, I would own every piece of work given to me and perform with excellence. I believe my value proposition to you is very strong and would welcome an introductory conversation.

</p>

<p> Thank you for taking the time to respond to me. I am doing a strategic job search because I have recently changed fields. I have applied to the job posting and feel my resume will not do me justice. I feel a brief conversation could help me fill in any gaps my resume may lack. Thank you for your time. Have a great day!</p>
